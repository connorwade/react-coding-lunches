My problem with teaching React is that whenever I teach people React, I have to assume that 50% of you don't really know React and I have to assume that 50% of you know React better than I do. So I'm going to try and focus on the newest version of the React docs and talking about what the React team sees as good practices. I'm also going to try and focus on coding.

Another thing about React, is that it is now the basis for so many frameworks, you really can't avoid it anymore. Qwik, Solid, Next.JS, and Remix all use React as their base. If you work in web development, you really should know React.

React also has so many third-party libraries that can be mixed in. I can't even begin to cover some of the most used ones. I also can't really cover stuff that is now just considered part of the React ecosystem like TailwindCSS.

So I'm going to try and stick entirely to React.

## What is React?

React is a UI framework from Facebook, that was made open-source in 2015. Back then your options for frontend frameworks were basically nothing except Angular. 

## Starting a New Project

React doesn't recommend using React on its own anymore actually. React recommends using it with a framework like Next.js, Remix, Gatsby, or Expo (for native apps). React on its own simply doesn't solve enough problems and doesn't scale. So in a way, React has definitely become a library more than a framework.

That being said, the React team recommends using Vite to start a new React project. You can also use Parcel to make a lightweight React project. Those are their recommendations.

## UI

- Look at the standard vite component together
1. Importing and exporting components
2. Writing markup with JSX
3. Passing Props to a Component
4. Conditional Rendering
5. Rendering Lists

## Adding Interactivity

1. State rendering and commiting
2. State is a snapshot

## Managing State

1. Lifting State Up
